Evolution of Monolithic Frontends

We initially have a frontend, backend and database all embedded within the same codebase and it's deployed the same as a whole, this is called a monolith.

Things evolved from monolith into frontend and backend where we split monolith into various teams.

Microservices are more specific to the backend . Backend evolved and people were ablt to create 
scalable architectures for backend.

For frontends , how will we scale our product with increasing dependency, that's where microfrontends come into picture.

We might be merging all the segments at runtime or there can be a container application for this purpose

Micro-frontends are the microservices for the frontends (or) scalable frontend architectures.

Browse restaurant, surprise me and my profile are basically three micro frontends here.
